# GPS airdrop
[简体中文](README_CN.md)

Since its creation, the GPS token contract has automatically airdropped 10 million GPS to 100,000 Binance Smart Chain (BSC) addresses, 100 for each address. Take the lead first and last until the end. The method of receiving GPS airdrops is very simple. Just use any wallet that supports BSC and add the GPS token contract address to see the GPS tokens airdropped.
